## Game #4 - "Castle Climber" - Platformer
"Castle Climber" is a small platformer using LUA and Pico-8. The game currrently contains a sprite and an ice platform to run around on. 
### Project Goals
My goals for this project were to become more familiar with level creation, create a sprite the player could move around, and become more familiar with Pico-8 and LUA.
### What I Did
During this project, I familiarized myself with the basics of Pico-8. Using this knowledge, I was able to create several sprites and graphics and code player input so the player sprite could be manipulated.
### What I Learned
During the six days I worked on this project, I learned how to create maps and "rooms" in Pico-8. I also learned how to code collision and gravity so the player wouldn't phase through the walls, floor, or ceiling of the level.
### How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
