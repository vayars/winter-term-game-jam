## Game #1 - "Memory" - Walking Simulator
"Memory" is a small walking simulator using Unreal Engine. The game contains two menus (a main and a pause menu) and a small environment to walk around in. For this project, I utilized the Unreal Engine First Person starter content and the Stylized Nature Pack by Tiny Talisman Games. 
### Project Goals
My goals with this project were to learn how to use Unreal Engine and Blueprints and to create a 3-D environment that a player could explore.
### What I Did
During this project, I learned the basics of Unreal Engine actors, textures, materials, and Blueprints. I also created a small 3-D environment to practice blocking and visualizing, and I utilized assets from the Unreal Marketplace so I could focus on building the world itself.
### What I Learned
At the end of my six days working on the game, I had learned the basics of Unreal Engine and Blueprints. I also learned how to create a simple 3-D environment. 
### How to Run
Currently, this folder just contains the source files for the game.
1. Clone this repository.
2. Load the project files in Unreal Engine. 
3. Select the 'Main' level.
