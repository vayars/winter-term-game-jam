## Game #1 - "Memory" - Walking Simulator
"Memory" is a small walking simulator using Unreal Engine. The game contains two menus (a main and a pause menu) and a small environment to walk around in. For this project, I utilized the Unreal Engine First Person starter content and the Stylized Nature Pack by Tiny Talisman Games. 
### How to Play
Currently, this folder just contains the source files for the game. To run the game, load the project in Unreal Engine. Then, from the 'Main' Level, choose "Standalone Game" for the play mode.
