## Game #2 - "Prisma" - Text Adventure
"Prisma" is a short text adventure coded in Python. The player must explore a nine-room ruin to gain access to a mysterious, multi-colored chalice.
### Project Goal
My goal for this project was to focus on creating fun narrative and game mechanics within a limited medium. Without the use of graphics and sound, I wanted to push how I could portray an interactive story through text alone.
### What I Did
I started this project by drafting the main plot and mechanics. I then moved onto creating several level drafts which employed some of the mechanics I had thought up. I also worked on creating several Python classes to track items, doors, and the player's location and inventory.
### What I learned
During the six days I worked on this project, I learned how to create and maintain a design document. Using this design document, I also learned how to create and implement a game mechanic. Finally, I learned how to more clearly document Python code.
### How to Play
Note: Only works with Python 3.10+

1. Clone this repository.
2. Execute `main.py` in the command line.
