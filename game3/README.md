## Game #3 - "Simple Picross" - Puzzle
For my third game, I've made a picross puzzle game using Java. Solve picross/nonogram to create small pictures. Currently consists of one level.
### How to Play
To run the game, compile all of the files in the `simple-picross/src` folder. Then execute `PicrossGame.java`.
