## Game #3 - "Simple Picross" - Puzzle
"Simple Picross" is a picross puzzle game using Java. The player must solve picross/nonogram puzzles to create small pictures. Currently consists of two levels.
### Project Goals
I had two goals for this project. Firstly, I wanted to create a mechanic-focused game (such as a puzzle game). Secondly, I wanted to expand my Java skills and knowledge.
### What I Did
I determined that I wanted to create a picross puzzle game and drafted several level ideas before settling on the two I implemeneted. I also researched different ways to create a GUI and receive user input in Java. This reserach lead to me using JFram, JPanel, and AWT.
### What I Learned
During the six days I worked on this game, I learned how to use JPanel, JFrame, and AWT to create an interactable GUI.
### How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Compile all of the files in `simple-picross/src` using `javac`.
3. Execute `PicrossGame.java` in the command line.
### How to Play
To play the game, left click a box to fill it in. Right click a box to "mark" it. Right click a marked box to unmark it.
