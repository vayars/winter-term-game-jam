# Overview
In February 2022, I plan on creating four small games in four different ways to broaden my coding knowledge and learn more about game design.

## Game #1 - "Memory" - Walking Simulator
For my first game, I've created a small walking simulator using Unreal Engine. The game contains two menus (a main and a pause menu) and a small environment to walk around in. For this project, I utilized the Unreal Engine First Person starter content and the Stylized Nature Pack by Tiny Talisman Games. 

## Game #2 - "Prisma" - Text Adventure
For my second game, I've created a short text adventure using Python. Explore a nine-room ruin to gain access to a mysterious chalice and escape.

## Game #3 - "Simple Picross" - Puzzle
For my third game, I've made a picross puzzle game using Java. Solve picross/nonogram puzzles to create small pictures. Currently consists of two levels.

## Game #4 - 2-D Platformer
For my fourth game, I plan on making a 2-D Platformer using LUA.
