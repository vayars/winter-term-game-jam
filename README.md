# Overview
In February 2022, I plan on creating four small games in four different ways to broaden my coding knowledge and learn more about game design.

## Game #1 - Walking Simulator
For my first game, I plan on making a walking simulator using Unreal Engine and C++.

## Game #2 - RPG
For my second game, I plan on making a command-line text adventure using C.

## Game #3 - Puzzle
For my third game, I plan on making a puzzle game using Java.

## Game #4 - 2-D Platformer
For my fourth game, I plan on making a 2-D Platformer using LUA and Pico-8.
