# Overview
In February 2022, I plan on creating four small games in four different ways to broaden my coding knowledge and learn more about game design.

## Game #1 - "Memory" - Walking Simulator
For my first game, I've created a small walking simulator using Unreal Engine. The game contains two menus (a main and a pause menu) and a small environment to walk around in. For this project, I utilized the Unreal Engine First Person starter content and the Stylized Nature Pack by Tiny Talisman Games. 
### How to Play
Currently, the Game 1 folder just contains the source files for the game. To run the game, load the project in Unreal Engine. Then, choose "Standalone Game" for the play mode. 

## Game #2 - RPG
For my second game, I plan on making a command-line text adventure using C.

## Game #3 - Puzzle
For my third game, I plan on making a puzzle game using Java.

## Game #4 - 2-D Platformer
For my fourth game, I plan on making a 2-D Platformer using LUA and Pico-8.
