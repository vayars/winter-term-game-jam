# Overview
In February 2022, I coded four small games in four different ways to broaden my coding knowledge and learn more about game design.

## Game #1 - "Memory" - Walking Simulator
For my first game, I've created a small walking simulator using Unreal Engine. The game contains two menus (a main and a pause menu) and a small environment to walk around in. For this project, I utilized the Unreal Engine First Person starter content and the Stylized Nature Pack by Tiny Talisman Games. 

## Game #2 - "Prisma" - Text Adventure
For my second game, I've created a short text adventure using Python. The player must explore a nine-room ruin to gain access to a mysterious chalice and escape.

## Game #3 - "Simple Picross" - Puzzle
For my third game, I've made a picross puzzle game using Java. The player must solve picross/nonogram puzzles to create small pictures. The game currently consists of two levels.

## Game #4 - "Castle Climber" - 2-D Platformer
For my fourth game, I've made a 2-D platformer using LUA and Pico-8. The player must leap their way to the top of an ice castle to save a captured prince. The game currently consists of the tutorial level.
