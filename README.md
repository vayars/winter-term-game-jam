# Overview
In February 2022, I plan on creating four small games in four different ways to broaden my coding knowledge and learn more about game design.

## Game #1 - "Memory" - Walking Simulator
For my first game, I've created a small walking simulator using Unreal Engine. The game contains two menus (a main and a pause menu) and a small environment to walk around in. For this project, I utilized the Unreal Engine First Person starter content and the Stylized Nature Pack by Tiny Talisman Games. 
### How to Play
Currently, the Game 1 folder just contains the source files for the game. To run the game, load the project in Unreal Engine. Then, from the 'Main' Level, choose "Standalone Game" for the play mode. 

## Game #2 - "Prisma" - Text Adventure
For my second game, I plan on making a short text adventure using Python.

## Game #3 - "Simple Picross" - Puzzle
For my third game, I've made a picross puzzle game using Java. Solve picross/nonogram to create small pictures. Currently consists of one level.
### How to Play
To run the game, compile all of the files in the `src` folder. Then execute `PicrossGame.java`.

## Game #4 - 2-D Platformer
For my fourth game, I plan on making a 2-D Platformer using LUA.
