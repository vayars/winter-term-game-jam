In February 2022, I plan on creating four small games in four different ways to broaden my coding knowledge and learn more about game design.

## Game #1 - 2-D Platformer
For my first game, I plan on making a 2-D Platformer using LUA and Pico-8.

For my second game, I plan on making a puzzle game using Java.

## Game #3 - Walking Simulator
For my thrid game, I plan on making a walking simulator using Unreal Engine or Unity.
